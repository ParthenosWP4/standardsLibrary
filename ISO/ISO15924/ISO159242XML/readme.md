#####ISO 15924 Codes for the representation of names of scripts

In this folder, we provide a XSL stylesheet that transforms the Alphabetical list of four-letter script names (provided by the Unicode consortium, ISO 15924 Registration Authority, and accessible at the URL http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/iso15924-text.html) in XML-TEI, and the corresponding XML-TEI output file.
The TEI output must be regenerated every once in a while. It's recommended to keep the name ISO15924_TEI.xml.
