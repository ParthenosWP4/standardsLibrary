# IANA to TEI

[IANA](http://www.iana.org/protocols), Internet Assigned numbers Authority, is responsible for maintaining many of the codes and numbers contained in a variety of Internet protocols, including a Language Subtag Registry, respecting the ISO 639 standard.
In this folder, we provide a XSL stylesheet that transforms the Language Subtag Registry (accessible with the URL http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry) in XML-TEI, and the corresponding XML-TEI output file.
The TEI output must be regenerated every once in a while. It's recommended to keep the name ISO639_TEI.xml.
