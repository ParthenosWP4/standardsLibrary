Arc uses the attributes to and from to define the traversal between named pairs of resources.Indicates the XLink element type.arc(Archival Description) A wrapper element for the bulk of an EAD document instance, which describes the content, context, and extent of a body of archival materials, including administrative and supplemental information that facilitates use of the materials. Information is organized in unfolding, hierarchical levels that allow for a descriptive overview of the whole to be followed by more detailed views of the parts, designated by the element Description of Subordinate Components dsc . Data elements available at the archdesc level are repeated at the various component levels within dsc, and information is inherited from one hierarchical level to the next.The hierarchical level of the materials being described by the element.classcollectionfondsitemotherlevelrecordgrpseriessubfondssubgrpsubseriesfilecan be used to categorize the finding aid as an inventory, register, or other format.(Archival Reference) A reference element that provides a citation and/or an electronic link to separately described archival materials of special interest. Examples of such materials include a record group and one of its large series (which might have separate EAD-encoded finding aids) and a general reference to a collection with similar content.(Arrangement) Information on how the described materials have been subdivided into smaller units, e.g., record groups into series, identifying the logical or physical groupings within a hierarchical structure. Can also be used to express the filing sequence of the described materials, such as the principle characteristics of the internal structure, or the physical or logical ordering of materials, including alphabetical, chronological, geographical, office of origin, and other schemes. Identifying logical groupings and the arrangement pattern may enhance retrieval by researchers.(Author) Name(s) of institution(s) or individual(s) responsible for compiling the intellectual content of the finding aid. May include a brief statement indicating the nature of the responsibility, for example, archivist, collections processor, or records manager. Because acknowledgment of such individuals or institutions often appears on the title page of a finding aid, the author element is available in both the required titlestmt portion of the eadheader and the optional titlepage element in frontmatter.(Bibliography) Citations to works that are based on, about, or of special value when using the materials being described, or works in which a citation to or brief description of the materials is available.

Additional bioghist elements may be nested inside one another when a complex body of materials, such as a collection of family papers, is being described, and separately headed sections are desired. The bioghist element may also be nested to designate a portion of the essay or chronology that might be extracted as a MARC 545 subfield.(Block Quote) A formatting element that designates an extended quotation. The quotation is set off from the text by spacing or other typographic distinction.(Component (Unnumbered)) A wrapper element that designates a subordinate part of the materials being described. A Component c provides information about the content, context, and extent of a subordinate body of materials. It is always nested within a Description of Subordinate Components dsc and often within another c element. Each c element identifies an intellectually logical section of the described materials. The physical filing separations between components do not always coincide with the intellectual separations. For example, a c that designates dramatic works might end in the same box in which the next c begins with short stories. Also, not every c directly corresponds to a folder or other physical entity. Some c elements simply represent a stage within a hierarchical description.(Component (First Level)) A wrapper element that designates the top or first-level subordinate part of the materials being described. Components may be either unnumbered c or numbered c01, c02, etc. The numbered components c01 to c12 assist a finding aid encoder in nesting up to twelve component levels accurately.(Component (Second Level)) A wrapper element that designates a second-level subordinate part of the materials being described.

Additions to a finding aid or significant recoding should be noted, but not correction of a few typographical errors. The change element is modeled on a header element in the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) DTD. The TEI recommends that revisions be entered and numbered in reverse chronological order, with the most recent change first.(Chronology List Item) A formatting element that keeps a date paired with an associated event or group of events within a Chronology List chronlist. Each chronitem contains a date (either a single date or date range) coupled with an event or description of what occurred during that time. When multiple events are associated with a single date, the events are bundled in an eventgrp tag, which is then easily paired with the appropriate date.(Chronology List) A formatting element that designates information about the sequence in which significant past events, associated with the described materials, occurred. The chronlist also provides a structured display to list these dates and events. Each chronlist contains Chronology Items chronitems that pair a date or date range with a brief description of an associated event or events eventgrp.(Table Column Specification) An empty formatting element that designates the position and size of a single column in a Table table. Attributes specify the unique name of the column, its unique number within the table, its width and rules, and the horizontal alignment of text within the column. The quantity of columns in a table is determined by the COLS attribute of the tgroup element, not by the number of colspecs defined. The values set for colspec override any values implied from tgroup or thead elements.1O1Oleftrightcenterjustifychar(Container) A did subelement for information that contributes to locating the described materials by indicating the kinds of devices that hold the materials and identifying any sequential numbers assigned to those devices. The container element is used most frequently at the component level, i.e., once a Description of Subordinate Components dsc has been opened. This storage information can help researchers understand how extensive the material is, especially in the absence of a specific physical extent statement at the component level.characterizes the element in some sense, using any convenient classification scheme or typology.(Controlled Access Headings) A wrapper element that designates key access points for the described materials and enables authority-controlled searching across finding aids on a computer network. Hundreds of names and subjects can appear in a finding aid. Prominence can be given to the major ones by bundling them together in a single place within the archdesc or within a large Component c and tagging them with controlaccess.(Corporate Name) The proper noun name that identifies an organization or group of people that acts as an entity. Examples include names of associations, institutions, business firms, nonprofit enterprises, governments, government agencies, projects, programs, religious bodies, churches, conferences, athletic contests, exhibitions, expeditions, fairs, and ships.(Creation) A subelement of the profiledesc portion of eadheader used for information about the encoding of the finding aid, including the person(s) or agency(ies) responsible for the encoding, the date, and the circumstances under which the encoding was done.(Custodial History) Information about the chain of ownership of the materials being described, before they reached the immediate source of acquisition. Both physical possession and intellectual ownership can be described, providing details of changes of ownership and/or custody that may be significant in terms of authority, integrity, and interpretation.(Digital Archival Object) A linking element that uses the attributes ENTITYREF or HREF to connect the finding aid information to electronic representations of the described materials. The dao and daogrp elements allow the content of an archival collection or record group to be incorporated in the finding aid. These digital representations include graphic images, audio or video clips, images of text pages, and electronic transcriptions of text. The objects can be selected examples, or digital surrogates all the materials in an archival fonds or series.(Digital Archival Object Description) Information about the contents, usage, or source of a Digital Archival Object dao or Digital Archival Object Group daogrp. When the unittitle or other descriptive information in a Component c is sufficient to identify one or more digital objects, the daodesc caption is not necessary.(Digital Archival Object Group) A wrapper element that contains two or more related Digital Archival Object Locations daoloc that should be thought of as a group and may share a single common Digital Archival Object Description daodesc. They may also form an extended link group to enable a set of multidirectional links. The dao, daogrp, and daoloc elements allow the content of the described materials to be incorporated in the finding aid.(Digital Archival Object Location) The location of a Digital Archival Object dao that is a resource in an extended link. Within a Digital Archival Object Group daogrp, a daoloc element is used instead of a dao element to indicate that an extended, possibly multidirectional link is being tagged. See also related elements dao, daogrp, and daodesc.(Date) A generic element that contains a month, day, or year in any format. Use date to identify any dates that merit encoding, except for the creation and other relevant dates of the described materials, which are instead tagged with the unitdate element. Examples of dates that might merit encoding are a person's birth date, the date the materials were acquired, or the date of an event in a chronology. These dates may be entered in the form of text or numbers, and may consist of a single date or range of dates.(Definition List Item) A formatting element in a special type of list that keeps an entry in a list (called a label) paired with its definition, description, or explanation (called an item).

The various did subelements are intended for brief, clearly designated statements of information and, except for note, do not require Paragraphs p to enter text.(Dimensions) A subelement of physdesc for information about the size of the materials being described; usually includes numerical data. Measurements may be expressed in any convenient unit. Attributes may be used when the unit of measurement or type of dimension is not clear in the finding aid text. The UNIT attribute specifies the kind of measurement, for example, "inches" or "meters." The TYPE attribute specifies the kind of dimensions being measured, for example, "height" or "circumference." Multiple dimensions, for example, height-by-width, can be tagged in a single dimensions element or in separate dimensions with distinctive attribute values.(Text Division) A generic element that designates a major section of text within frontmatter. Examples of these text divisions include a title page, preface, acknowledgments, or instructions for using a finding aid. Use the head element to identify the div's purpose.(Description of Subordinate Components) A wrapper element that bundles information about the hierarchical groupings of the materials being described. The subordinate components can be presented in several different forms or levels of descriptive detail, which are identified by the element's required TYPE attribute. For example, "analyticover" identifies an overview description of series and subseries, which might be followed by a second dsc with the TYPE attribute set to "in-depth" that provides a more detailed listing of the content of the materials, including information about the container numbers associated with those materials. The TYPE attribute value "combined" is used when the description of a series is followed immediately by a listing of the contents of that series. The TYPE attribute "othertype" is for models that do not follow any of the above-mentioned formats, in which case the OTHERTYPE attribute can then be used to specify a particular presentation model.characterizes the element in some sense, using any convenient classification scheme or typology.analyticovercombinedin-depthothertype(Encoded Archival Description) The outermost wrapper element for an information access tool known generically as a finding aid.

Additional types include a drawing of a room layout or a scientific scheme.(Front Matter) A wrapper element that bundles prefatory text found before the start of the Archival Description archdesc. It focuses on the creation, publication, or use of the finding aid rather than information about the materials being described. Examples include a title page, preface, dedication, and instructions for using a finding aid. The optional titlepage element within frontmatter can be used to repeat selected information from the eadheader to generate a title page that follows local preferences for sequencing information. The other frontmatter structures, such as a dedication, are encoded as Text Divisions divs, with a head element containing word(s) that identify the nature of the text.(Function) Terms for the spheres of activities and processes that generated the described materials. Such terms often provide useful access points to the materials, especially for corporate, government, or institutional records. Examples include: collecting taxes and entertaining.(Genre/Physical Characteristic) A term that identifies the types of material being described, by naming the style or technique of their intellectual content (genre); order of information or object function (form); and physical characteristics.

It is seldom, if ever, appropriate to use imprint in a citation for an unpublished work cited in a bibref.(Index) A list of key terms and reference pointers that have been assembled to enhance access to the materials being described. The index can also serve as a helpful alphabetical overview of subjects, correspondents, photographers, or other entities represented in the collection. This back-of-the volume index may provide hypertext links, or it may note the container numbers useful for locating the position in the finding aid where the indexed material appears.(Index Entry) A formatting element that pairs an index term with one or more linking elements. Each indexentry contains an access element, such as namegrp or subject; an optional note that can divide the entry into subcategories, e.g., "during office" and "family life"; followed by optional Pointer ptr, Pointer Group ptrgrp, or Reference ref elements. Plain text cannot be used in an indexentry. If the indexentry subelements are expected to provide access points other than basic keyword retrieval, use controlled vocabulary terms to facilitate access to information within and across finding aid systems, with the SOURCE attribute to indicate which vocabulary provided the term.(Item) A formatting element used in one of three contexts: as an entry in a simple, random, or ordered list; as part of a defitem inside a definition list; or as an entry within the change element. In the first instance, the item can be a number, word, or phrase. In a definition list, which is usually displayed as two columns, a defitem pairs a label with a corresponding item containing text that defines, describes, or explains the terms or other text tagged as the label. In the eadheader revisiondesc change element, the item designates information about a revision to the finding aid and is often paired with a date.(Label) A formatting element that identifies the term or concept being described, defined, or explained in a Definition List Item defitem. The defitem can be thought of as an entry in a list that is usually displayed in two columns: label followed by item.

Examples of material specific details include mathematical data, such as scale for cartographic and architectural records, jurisdictional and denominational data for philatelic records, and physical presentation data for music records.(Name) The proper noun or noun phrase designation for an entity that is difficult to tag more specifically as a corpname, famname, geogname, persname, or title. The name element may be used in place of the more specific access elements when it is not known what kind of name is being described or when a high degree of precision is unnecessary. For example, the name element might be used in an indexentry when it is not clear if the name "Bachrach" refers to a person or a photographic corporation.(Name Group) A formatting element used in an indexentry to group access element entries that share the same ref, ptr, or ptrgrp element. A note is available to divide a name or term into subcategories, for example, "during office" and "family life."(Note) A generic element that provides a short statement explaining the text, indicating the basis for an assertion, or citing the source of a quotation or other information. Used both for general comments and as an annotation for the text in a finding aid. Not used when more specific content designation elements are appropriate, e.g., abstract, altformavail, archref, or scopecontent. Do not confuse with Other Descriptive Data odd element, which is used within archdesc and c to designate information that is more than a short comment in a note.&gt;embednewonloadonrequest(Note Statement) An optional subelement within the filedesc portion of the eadheader that groups note elements, each of which contains a single piece of descriptive information about the finding aid. These notes are similar to the "general notes" in traditional bibliographic descriptions.(Number) A generic element for numeric information in any form.

The origination element may be used to indicate such agents as correspondents, records creators, collectors, and dealers. Using the LABEL attribute may help identify for a finding aid reader the role of the originator, e.g., "creator," "collector," or "photographer." It is also possible to set the ROLE attribute on the name elements that are available within origination, i.e., corpname, famname, name, and persname.(Other Finding Aid) Information about additional or alternative guides to the described material, such as card files, dealers' inventories, or lists generated by the creator or compiler of the materials. It is used to indicate the existence of additional finding aids; it is not designed to encode the content of those guides.(Paragraph) One or more sentences that form a logical prose passage. A paragraph may be a subdivision of a larger composition, or it may exist alone. It is usually typographically distinct: A line space is often left blank before it; the text begins on a new line; and the first letter of the first word is often indented, enlarged, or both.

Specific aspects of each of these activities may be encoded separately within other elements, such as acqinfo, arrangement, physloc, etc.(Profile Description) An optional subelement of the eadheader that bundles information about the creation of the encoded version of the finding aid, including the name of the agent, place, and date of encoding. The profiledesc element also designates the predominant and minor languages used in the finding aid.(Pointer) An empty internal linking element that uses attributes to provide for movement from one place in a finding aid to another place in the same finding aid. Unlike the ref element, the ptr element cannot contain text and subelements to describe the referenced object.(Pointer Group) A wrapper element for two or more Pointer ptr or Reference ref elements used in an indexentry. Pointers and references are internal links that provide for movement from one place in the finding aid to another place in the same finding aid. When encoding an index in EAD, a name or entry is generally listed only once, followed by a ptrgrp containing the series of pointers and references that link the name or entry to the places in the finding aid where it appears. The ptrgrp prevents the name or entry from having to appear multiple times in the index.(Pointer Location) The location of a pointer ptr that is a resource in an extended link.(Publication Statement) A wrapper element within the filedesc portion of eadheader for information concerning the publication or distribution of the encoded finding aid, including the publisher's name and address, the date of publication, and other relevant details.(Publisher) When used in the publicationstmt portion of eadheader and in the titlepage element in frontmatter, the publisher is the name of the party responsible for issuing or distributing the encoded finding aid. Often this party is the same corporate body identified in the repository element in the finding aid. When used in the imprint section of a Bibliographic Reference bibref, the publisher is the name of the party issuing a monograph or other bibliographic work cited in the finding aid.(Reference) An internal linking element that provides for movement from one place in a finding aid to another place in the same finding aid. Unlike the internal Pointer ptr element, the ref element may contain text and subelements that identify or describe the referenced object. The ref element may be used in a variety of ways in an encoded finding aid. For example, a ref may provide a dynamic link from one Component c to another related Component c in the same way that See and See also references direct readers of paper-based finding aids. Or, a ref might be used to direct the reader from text in a scope and content note to a description of a Component c in a contents list.Indicates the XLink element type.simpleCreates a simple link.extendedCreates an extended link.locatorCreates a locater link that points to a resource.arcCreates an arc with multiple resources and various traversal paths.resourceCreates a resource link, which indicates a specific resource.titleCreates a title link. Such elements are useful for internationalization purposes.(Reference Location) A linking element that provides the location of a reference ref that is a resource in an extended link.(Related Material) Information about materials that are not physically or logically included in the material described in the finding aid but that may be of use to a reader because of an association to the described materials. Materials designated by this element are not related to the described material by provenance, accumulation, or use.(Repository) The institution or agency responsible for providing intellectual access to the materials being described. The corpname element may be used within repository to encode the institution's proper name.(Resource) A linking element that specifies the local resource that participates in an extended link.(Revision Description) An optional subelement of the eadheader for information about changes or alterations that have been made to the encoded finding aid. The revisions may be recorded as part of a list or as a series of change elements. Like much of the eadheader, the revisiondesc element is modeled on an element found in the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) DTD. The TEI recommends that revisions be numbered and appear in reverse chronological order, with the most recent change first.(Table Row) A formatting element that contains one or more entry elements (horizontal cells) in a table.10topmiddlebottom(Runner) An optional formatting element that provides for a header, footer, or watermark to appear on every page of a printed finding aid or throughout an electronic version. If a transparent image is desired as background, use extptr instead. The runner is available within archdesc and archdescgrp and must appear before the did. The PLACEMENT attribute specifies whether the runner should appear as a header, footer, or watermark.headerfooterwatermark(Scope and Content) A prose statement summarizing the range and topical coverage of the described materials, often mentioning the form and arrangement of the materials and naming significant organizations, individuals, events, places, and subjects represented. The purpose of the scopecontent element is to assist readers in evaluating the potential relevance of the materials to their research. It may highlight particular strengths of, or gaps in, the described materials and may summarize in narrative form some of the descriptive information entered in other parts of the finding aid.(Separated Material) Information about materials that are associated by provenance to the described materials but that have been physically separated or removed. (Series Statement) A wrapper element within the filedesc portion of eadheader that groups information about the published monographic series, if any, to which an encoded finding aid belongs. The seriesstmt may contain just text, laid out in Paragraphs p, or it may include the titleproper and num elements, which allow for more specific tagging of names or numbers associated with the series.(Sponsor) Name(s) of institution(s) or individual(s) who endorsed, financed, or arranged the acquisition, appraisal, and processing of the described materials or the preparation and distribution of the finding aid. Because acknowledgment of such contributors often appears on title pages of finding aids, the sponsor element is available in both the optional titlepage element in frontmatter and in the required titlestmt portion of the eadheader. Do not confuse with author, which is used to denote the persons or institutions responsible for the intellectual content of the finding aid, or with repository, which is used to identify the institution or corporate body providing intellectual access to the described materials.(Subordinate Area) A name or phrase that indicates a secondary or subsidiary administrative level within a repository or other corporate body; a specialized area of subject or other collecting emphasis within a larger unit; or an ancillary collecting area based on the physical form of the materials.(Subject) A term that identifies a topic associated with or covered by the described materials. Personal, corporate, and geographic names behaving as subjects are tagged as persname, corpname, and geogname, respectively. The ROLE attribute can be set to "subject" when it is necessary to specify the relationship of the name to the materials being described.(Subitle) A secondary or subsidiary name of an encoded finding aid that is subordinate to the main name encoded in titleproper. The subtitle element is available only within titlepage and titlestmt to capture bibliographic aspects of the finding aid. Subtitles of monographs, serials, paintings, and other such works mentioned in the finding aid are not separately encoded, but they may be listed as part of the title element.(Table) A wrapper element for formatting information in a row and column display.topbottomtopbotallsidesnone101010(Table Body) A formatting element that contains one or more row elements, which in turn contain entry elements in a table. The tbody element identifies the body of the information in a table, as distinct from the column headings (Table Head thead).topmiddlebottom(Table Group) A formatting element that bundles table subelements: colspec, thead, and tbody. Tables are comprised of one or more tgroups, depending on the number of times the column specifications change. The tgroup element provides a subgrouping of rows within a table that all use the same column specifications.1010leftrightcenterjustifychar(Table Head) A formatting element that contains the heading information in a table, usually column heads, that appears at the top of the table and may appear again at the top of any physical break in rows in the body. The thead element is used inside an ordinary structural table and to provide column headings for Components c or the Description of Subordinate Components dsc.topmiddlebottom(Title) The formal name of a work, such as a monograph, serial, or painting, listed in a finding aid. Subtitles of such works are not separately encoded but may instead be listed as part of the title element.(Title Page) A wrapper element within frontmatter that groups bibliographic information about an encoded finding aid, including its name, author, and other aspects of its creation and publication. It contains much of the same information found in the filedesc portion of the eadheader, such as the titleproper, subtitle, author, sponsor, publisher, and date of the finding aid. Although it is possible to generate an electronic or printed title page directly from the eadheader, use of the titlepage may be more accommodating of local preferences, including displays of photographic illustrations, institutional logos, or other graphic images.(Title Proper of the Finding Aid) The name of the finding aid or finding aid series.(Title Statement) A required wrapper element within the filedesc portion of eadheader that groups information about the name of an encoded finding aid and those responsible for its intellectual content. Like much of the eadheader, the titlestmt element is modeled on an element found in the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) DTD, and its subelements must adhere to the following prescribed sequence: a required titleproper, followed by an optional subtitle, optional author, and optional sponsor.(Date of the Unit) The creation year, month, or day of the described materials. The unitdate may be in the form of text or numbers, and may consist of a single date or range of dates. As an important subelement of the Descriptive Identification did, the unitdate is used to tag only the creation and other relevant dates of the materials described in the encoded finding aid. Do not confuse it with the date element, which is used to tag all other dates.characterizes the element in some sense, using any convenient classification scheme or typology.bulkinclusiveTerm characterizing the nature of dates, such as dates of creation, accumulation, or modification.(ID of the Unit) Any alpha-numeric text string that serves as a unique reference point or control number for the described material, such as a lot number, an accession number, a classification number, or an entry number in a bibliograph y or catalog. An important subelement of the Descriptive Identification did, the unitid is primarily a logical designation, which sometimes secondarily provides location information, as in the case of a classification number. Use other did subelements, such as physloc and container, to designate specifically the physical location of the described materials.A unique code indicating the repository responsible for intellectual control of the materials being described.((AF|AX|AL|DZ|AS|AD|AO|AI|AQ|AG|AR|AM|AW|AU|AT|AZ|BS|BH|BD|BB|BY|BE|BZ|BJ|BM|BT|BO|BA|BW|BV|BR|IO|BN|BG|BF|BI|KH|CM| CA|CV|KY|CF|TD|CL|CN|CX|CC|CO|KM|CG|CD|CK|CR|CI|HR|CU|CY|CZ|DK|DJ|DM|DO|EC|EG|SV|GQ|ER|EE|ET|FK|FO|FJ|FI|FR|GF|PF|TF|GA|GM|GE |DE|GH|GI|GR|GL|GD|GP|GU|GT|GN|GW|GY|HT|HM|VA|HN|HK|HU|IS|IN|ID|IR|IQ|IE|IL|IT|JM|JP|JO|KZ|KE|KI|KP|KR|KW|KG|LA|LV|LB|LS|LR|LY |LI|LT|LU|MO|MK|MG|MW|MY|MV|ML|MT|MH|MQ|MR|MU|YT|MX|FM|MD|MC|MN|MS|MA|MZ|MM|NA|NR|NP|NL|AN|NC|NZ|NI|NE|NG|NU|NF|MP|NO|OM|PK|PW| PS|PA|PG|PY|PE|PH|PN|PL|PT|PR|QA|RE|RO|RU|RW|SH|KN|LC|PM|VC|WS|SM|ST|SA|SN|CS|SC|SL|SG|SK|SI|SB|SO|ZA|GS|ES|LK|SD|SR|SJ|SZ|SE|CH |SY|TW|TJ|TZ|TH|TL|TG|TK|TO|TT|TN|TR|TM|TC|TV|UG|UA|AE|GB|US|UM|UY|UZ|VU|VE|VN|VG|VI|WF|EH|YE|ZM|ZW)| ([a-zA-Z]{1})|([a-zA-Z]{3,4}))(-[a-zA-Z0-9:/\-]{1,11})A machine-readable unique identifier.(Title of the Unit) The name, either formal or supplied, of the described materials. May consist of a word, phrase, character, or group of characters. As an important subelement of the Descriptive Identification did, the unittitle encodes the name of the described materials at both the highest unit or archdesc level (e.g., collection, record group, or fonds) and at all the subordinate Component c levels (e.g., subseries, files, items, or other intervening stages within a hierarchical description).(Conditions Governing Use) Information about conditions that affect use of the described materials after access has been granted.Left span boundaryinternalexternalA field or element in another descriptive encoding system to which an EAD element or attribute is comparable.The three-lettter code for the language in which an abstract is written abstract, for the language of the finding aid and the language of the materials language.The four-letter code for the writing script used with a given language.characterizes the element in some sense, using any convenient classification scheme or typology.A unique code for the country in which the materials being described are held.A consistent form, usually from a controlled vocabulary list to facilitate retrievalThe authoritative source or rules for values supplied in the countrycode attribute in eadid and unitid.Language encoding for EAD instances subscribes to ISO 639-2b Codes for the Representation of Names of Languages, so the langencoding attribute value in eadheader should be "iso639-2b."
