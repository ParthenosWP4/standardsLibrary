#### Summary
[EADSpec.xml](https://github.com/ParthenosWP4/standardsLibrary/tree/master/archivalDescription/EAD/odd/EADSpec.xml) is an [ODD](http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/Customization/odds.xml) ('One Document Does it all') file that describe the specifications of the XML-EAD format. With this ODD file, you can generate a RelaxNG Schema, HTML documentation, Schematron rules and more.
To generate all these files from ODD, you can use, for example, the [TEI ROMA tool](http://www.tei-c.org/Roma/).

More important, you can use this ODD file as a basis for your own customization of the XML-EAD format, by adding additionnal constraints, limited set of values for elements, ...

To such customizations, you need to create a new ODD file and add your own constraints. You can use [EAD-custom-template.xml](https://github.com/ParthenosWP4/standardsLibrary/tree/master/archivalDescription/EAD/odd/EAD-custom-template.xml) to get started.
