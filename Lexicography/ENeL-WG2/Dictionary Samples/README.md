# Dictionary Samples

We have structured the collection by dictionaries, rather than by contributing researchers or institutions. 

Each sample, however, contains a readme with basic information about the source, the represented formats (image, xml, schema etc.), the dictionary object language and metalangage, as well as the contributor.
