# Playground for Lexical Data

Welcome to the "official playground" of the ENeL WG2 "Retrodigitized Dictionaries" and the DARIAH-EU WG "Lexical Resources".

It's an official playground, not only because the world is always in dire need of oxymorons, but because this is a space for experimentation for the above-mentioned groups. 

Here, we'll be collecting various dictionary samples in order to illustrate and explore multiple approaches to digitizing dictionaries and modeling their data.

In cooperation with colleagues from the Parthenos WG, we will also over time crystallize best-practice guidelines to emphasize standards-compliant solutions to concrete lexicographic problems.

Everything you see here at the moment is a work in progress, which means why you should take it with a grain of salt. 

## Blog

This playground is a companion to our blog: [Digilex: Legacy Dictionaries in the Digital Age](http://digilex.hypotheses.org/), which we see as a platform for sharing tips and discussing issues related to digitizing dictionaries.

## Intended Audience

Both the blog and the playground will not be covering advanced topics only. We would like our collections and our posts to be helpful also to those scholars or projects who are just starting with their work on digital editions of print dictionaries. 

## How to contribute

We're looking forward to your questions, ideas and, especially, more dictionary samples. Show us what your encoded dictionaries look like, tell us what about your workflows, schemas, favorite tools. 

Feel free to get in touch with Toma Tasovac (ttasovac@humanistika.org).
