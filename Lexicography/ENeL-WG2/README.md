# Dictionary Samples

This is a collection of dictionary samples, collected by the DARIAH-EU WG "Lexical Resources" and the European Network of eLexicography WG2 "Retrodigitized Dictionaries".

The goal of this collection of samples to illustrate multiple approaches to digitizing dictionaries and modeling their data.

Some of the samples collected here are works in progress. 

## Structure
We have structured the collection by dictionaries, rather than by contributing researchers or institutions. 

Each sample, however, contains a readme with basic information about the source.
