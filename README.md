## Library of Standard-based tools for Humanities

This GitHub environment is part of the standards ecosystem framework of Parthenos WP4.
It is built to provide information about standards and, more important, to give researchers models and tools they can use, transform, â€¦
For instance, this repository must be considered as a standards toolkit and its instruction manuals.

This repository is structured in categories, by disciplines, but also to answer the potential needs that researchers can have during the sequence of a research project, whatever it is.
